# Email/SMS Spam Classifier
This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning model to differentiate between spam and legitimate messages in emails and SMS. Leveraging techniques such as data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and text preprocessing, the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is employed for its superior accuracy and efficiency. A user-friendly Streamlit application accompanies the model, providing individuals with a seamless tool to classify messages and enhance communication security. With the goal of empowering users to filter out unwanted messages, this project contributes to creating a safer online experience and mitigating potential threats.

## Key Features:

- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
- Text preprocessing using tokenization, removal of stop words and punctuation, and stemming
* Implementation of the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for classification
- Development of a user-friendly Streamlit application for message classification
- Continuous monitoring and feedback mechanisms for model improvement

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning
- Streamlit for building the web application
- GitHub for version control and collaboration
